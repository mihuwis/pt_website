                    Simply, with their help I achieved my goal of putting on weight,

                <h3>After major hip surgery I was unable to undertake strenuous exercise.
                    My trainer tailored the sessions to meet my specific rehabilitation needs.
                    He clearly put a lot of time into designing the sessions which were full of variety and a lot of fun. 
                    Trainer challenged me within my injury capabilities but made sure there was no risk of damage to my hip.
                    He had a thorough understanding of how the body works.  </h3>

                <h3>What I like about Personal Trainer is that he knows how to motivate me, 
                    he makes each of my training sessions challenging but rewarding. 
                    I would have no hesitation in recommending him as your personal 
                    trainer if you want to achieve your fitness and health goals. </h3>
